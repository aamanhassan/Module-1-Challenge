Excel Analysis 
•	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

1.	The most common outcome is “successful” followed by ‘failed”. There are fewer cancelled outcomes, indicating a general trend of successful crowdfunding. 
2.	There are high successful outcomes in the summer months (June and July). Whereas Failed campaigns shows variation with Feb to May having higher numbers and the end of year (December) shows a relatively higher number of cancellations.
3.	Categories like theater, music, film and video have notable number of both successful and failed campaigns. Whereas, technology and publishing, have relatively higher successful outcomes.

•	What are some limitations of this dataset?

The dataset does not incorporate external factors that could         impact crowdfunding success such as economic trends, holidays or social events.
The dataset is also missing some data (left blank) as well as missing some crucial information, such as the reason behind campaign success or failure.

•	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide? 
Creating a new chart to compare crowdfunding performance across various regions would add significant value by identifying the most successful region for future campaigns while also highlighting regions to avoid.

•	Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.

By analyzing the data, we can see, that the mean values for both successful and failed campaign are higher than the median, which suggest that the data might not be evenly distributed around the mean.
Furthermore, if we look at the data both successful and failed campaigns, have relatively high standard deviation. Which also indicates the data is highly variable. In such case median would better summarize the data.


•	Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?

The data also suggest that there is more variability in the funding number of successful campaigns to failed campaigns. The higher standard deviation for successful campaigns implies that successful campaigns have a wider range of funding amounts, indicating more variability in the level of support they receive. It does make sense because there might be few times when the crowdfunding will be exponential, while at other times there may be less or close to zero crowdfunding so there is more variability.
